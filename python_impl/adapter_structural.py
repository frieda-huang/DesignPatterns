"""
Adapter structural pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two objects that couldnâ€™t otherwise communicate 
due to differences in their interfaces.

Basic Structure
- Client
- Target interface is the interface that the client expects
- Adaptee is the existing class that has an incompatible interface
- Adapter implements the target interface and translates the requests from the client to the adaptee
